# UE5CryptRaider
Repository holding the Crypt Raider tutorial I completed from the UDemy Course: "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ &amp; Make Video Games"

If you are using Visual Studio and would like to have a solution for the project, make sure to "Generate Visual Studio files" from the .uproject file. Other than that the C++ files should be in the Source folder.
